Tnm Test Suite
--------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tnm Tcl
extension. Each of the files whose name ends in ".test" is intended to
fully exercise one or a few Tnm features. The features tested by a
given file are listed in the first line of the file. The test suite is
nowhere near complete yet. Contributions of additional tests would be
most welcome.

You can run the tests by typing "make test" in the platform dependent
directory; this will run all of the tests.

In either case no output will be generated if all goes well, except
for a listing of the tests.  If there are errors then additional
messages will appear.

For more details on the testing environment, see the README file in
the Tcl test directory.
