This directory contains some example scripts. The purpose of this
scripts if to show how you can program your own management solutions
with Tcl/Tk/Scotty. Most of them are small and hopefully easy to
understand, although the mibtree script has grown to a more complete
MIB browser.

This directory also contains sample CGI scripts we have written to
make our SNMP MIB parser and the GDMO mib parser available through the
WWW. The files are:

    sbrowser.cgi	- This is the experimental SNMP WWW browser.

    gbrowser.cgi	- This is the experimental GDMO WWW browser.

To install these services on your http server, you have to edit the
path to the scotty executable (if it is not in /usr/local/bin) and you
have to adjust the cgi path to your local convention. You will also
need to adjust the bitmap paths to meet your local server
configuration. To use the GDMO browser, you must configure scotty with
the --enable-gdmo option.
