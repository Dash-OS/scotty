Bugs
====

Debian
------
- Installing libsmi2-dev makes build break.

Generic
-------

### Build
- Should we revamp directory tree of installed files to reflect FHS or
  so (`share` instead of `library` ...)?
- Definitely eliminate legacy names and replace with "standard"
  autoconf/TEA names in Makefile.in.
- Man files must be installed in their corresponding sections
  (nmicmpd..); install-doc target.
- shell target: does not work.  Make the SCRIPT variable load Tnm.
- Check for missing install targets/routines.  Notably: scotty
  invocation after installing MIBs, man pages
- scotty does not build: unix/scotty.c:143: undefined reference to
  `Tcl_FindExecutable'

Tnm::dns
--------

- dns soa command does not return the whole information, example:

	`$ host -t soa iana.org
	iana.org has SOA record sns.dns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org. 2016111663 7200 3600 1209600 3600
	`
	`scotty% dns soa iana.org
	sns.dns.icann.org
	`
- (obsolete) dns hinfo command returns errorCode but the error message
   is a domain name, seemingly from the soa record, example:

	`$ host -t hinfo iana.org
	iana.org has no HINFO record
	`
	`scotty% dns hinfo iana.org
	sns.dns.icann.org
	`
