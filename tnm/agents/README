This directory contains some sample SNMP agent modules. This is
experimental work, but it might give you some ideas how to do your own
little agent with scotty.

Note, the SNMP agent stuff in this directory is not meant to replace
your standard MIB-2 SNMP agent. Instead, you should run this stuff as
an additional SNMP agent using a different port number.

The main script is snmpd. It includes the implementation of various
MIB modules contained in separate files. The files currently available
are:

  snmpd-tnm.tcl	- Implements some very simple tnm specific MIB
		  extensions - we use for debugging etc.

  snmpd-nfs.tcl	- Implements access to NFS server and client statistics
		  which are extracted by using the nfsstat program.

  snmpd-proc.tcl - Implements access to a table of running processes
		  and is based on the ps command.

  snmpd-mlm.tcl - An attempt to implement a modified version of the
		  MLM MIB (see draft-levi-snmp-mid-level-mgr-00.txt).
		  Includes some scripts static that can be activated.

*** WARNING !!! ***

Implementing MIBS can be quite dangerous to your system security! For
example, the tubs.tcl code contains a simple tclEvalTable which can
store arbitrary Tcl commands which are executed by the agent. This can
be used by everyone allowed to perform sets on your agent! So choose
good community strings, or better use SNMPv2USEC with authentication
or even better do not evaluate arbitrary commands!

We recommend to make use of safe Tcl interpreters. Here is how you
create a safe SNMP agent using safe Tcl:

	set s [snmp session -port 8888 -user joe -password $cryptic]
	$s configure -agent [interp create -safe]

A simple programming error while exporting an alias to a safe Tcl
interpreter can again introduce security problems. Thats why we still
recommend to run the agent on an account that can't do harm to your
system.

*** YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!! ***
