Bugs
====

- Generic
    - Build
        - Should we revamp directory tree of installed files to
        reflect FHS or so (`share` instead of `library` ...)?

        - Definitely eliminate legacy names and replace with "standard"
                    autoconf/TEA names in Makefile.in.

        - Man files must be installed in their corresponding sections; install-doc target.

Tests
=====

- Debian
    - tkined starts up, but the icon bar is not shown

Wishlist
========

- Port to:
  - OpenIndiana (Solaris)
  - Alpine Linux
  - Windows
