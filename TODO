Bugs:
=====

- macOS:
    - -lresolv not issued by ./configure.
- Debian:
    - Installing libsmi2-dev makes build break.

- Generic
    - Build
      - Should we revamp directory tree of installed files to reflect FHS
        or so (`share` instead of `library` ...)?
      - Definitely eliminate legacy names and replace with "standard"
        autoconf/TEA names in Makefile.in.
      - Man files must be installed in their corresponding sections
        (nmicmpd..); install-doc target.
      - test target: note that it 'works' as is (almost) if we link
        tnm/tests to top_builddir.  However tests most probably don't
        work as expected when the respective accessories are not
        installed where they are expected.
      - shell target: does not work.  Make the SCRIPT variable load
        Tnm.
      - Implement missing uninstall targets.
      - Check for missing install targets/routines.  Notably: scotty
        invocation after installing MIBs
